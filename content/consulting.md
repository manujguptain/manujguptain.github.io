title: "Advisory"
summary: "Helping engineering teams move from plan to delivery."

I have spent 20 years inside engineering programs — running them, scaling them, and delivering them across telecom, automotive, and research environments. That experience is what I bring to advisory work.

I work with a focused set of engagements at a time. The problems I am most useful for:

**Program delivery that has stalled.**
Scope is unclear, ownership is diffuse, the plan exists but nobody trusts it. I help identify what is actually blocking progress and get things moving again.

**Engineering operations at scale.**
Teams that have grown from 10 to 40 or 50 people and the coordination overhead has started eating the output. Planning, tracking, decision flow — where is the friction, and how do you reduce it without adding more process.

**Technical leads stepping into management.**
The shift from individual contributor to delivery owner is harder than it looks. I have navigated that transition across multiple organisations and contexts, and I know where the leverage points are.
