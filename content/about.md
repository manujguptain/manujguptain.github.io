## Work

Twenty years leading engineering and R&D teams across research 
consultancy, telecom, and automotive. Departments of 40 to 100 people, 
sometimes more — spanning firmware, embedded systems, integration, 
and delivery. Different sectors, same core job: take a complex program 
with unclear ownership and too many moving parts, and get it to ship.

The scale has varied. Early on, small teams, fast cycles. Later, 
40 to 100 engineers across India and Europe, 
running safety-critical automotive embedded programs where integration 
errors have real consequences. I have managed programs, 
built teams from scratch, and inherited ones mid-crisis. Both taught me 
things the other couldn't.

What I have learned to do reasonably well: spot where delivery risk is 
quietly building before it becomes visible, get ownership clarified without 
making it political, and keep programs moving when conditions are not ideal — 
which is most of the time.

## Life

I live in Bengaluru with my two kids.

I study Vedic Astrology when time allows. It sounds far from engineering 
but the underlying questions are similar — how do you make good decisions 
with incomplete information, and how do you stay grounded when the situation 
is uncertain.

I write here occasionally. Program delivery, team structure, career moves. 
Things I have been through or am still figuring out.
