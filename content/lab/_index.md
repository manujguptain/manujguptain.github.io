I have always liked to build things.

The Lab is where I keep my projects and experiments. It is a space for me to try out new ideas and see how things work firsthand. It might be a technical challenge, smart home automation, or just something I am curious about at the moment.

I do this because I enjoy the process of figuring things out. It keeps me sharp, it’s fun, and it gives me a place to share what I am currently tinkering with.

Everything here is a work in progress.
