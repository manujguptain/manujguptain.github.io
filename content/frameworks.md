I don’t believe in over-complicating management. Over the years, I’ve found that a few simple, consistent habits are what actually make the difference between a project that ships and one that gets stuck.

These are the three main frameworks I use:

### 1. [Regular Cadence](#)
A program needs a heartbeat. I set up a regular rhythm of short, focused meetings designed specifically to find and fix bottlenecks fast. It’s not about status reporting; it’s about clearing the path for the team so they can keep moving.

### 2. [The DRI Framework](#)
Borrowed from Apple, the **Directly Responsible Individual (DRI)** concept ensures that every task, risk, or decision has exactly one name next to it. When "everyone" is responsible, no one is. This brings total clarity to who is owning the outcome.

### 3. [The Innovation Box](#)
Engineering teams need space to try new things, but that shouldn't derail the main delivery schedule. I use the Innovation Box to create a "safe zone" where we can experiment and fail fast without putting the primary project at risk.
